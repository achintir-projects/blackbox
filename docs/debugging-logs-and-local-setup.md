# Debugging Wallet Creation Issue: Enhanced Logging and Local Setup Guide

## 1. Enhanced Error Handling and Logging

To capture detailed logs and errors in your API routes and wallet creation logic:

- Add `console.log` statements before and after critical operations.
- Use `try-catch` blocks to catch and log errors explicitly.
- Log request payloads and responses in API routes.
- Example snippet for API route logging:

```ts
export async function POST(req: Request) {
  try {
    const body = await req.json()
    console.log('Received request body:', body)
    // Your logic here
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error processing request:', error)
    throw error
  }
}
```

- In wallet creation scripts, log key steps and catch errors similarly.

## 2. Running Backend Locally for Easier Debugging

- Clone your repository locally if not already done.
- Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`.
- Set up your `.env` file with the correct database URL and other environment variables.
- Run the development server locally: `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.
- The terminal will show all console logs and errors in real-time.
- Use tools like Postman or curl to test API endpoints directly.
- This local setup allows you to debug and fix issues faster.

## 3. Capturing Logs on Vercel or Other Hosting Services

- Vercel captures `console.log` and `console.error` output in its dashboard under the "Logs" section.
- Ensure your deployment environment variables are correctly set.
- For persistent or advanced logging, consider integrating a logging service like:
  - LogRocket
  - Sentry
  - Datadog
  - Papertrail
- These services provide error tracking, log aggregation, and alerting.

## Summary

- Add detailed logging and error handling in your code.
- Run the backend locally to see logs and debug interactively.
- Use Vercel logs or integrate a logging service for production monitoring.
